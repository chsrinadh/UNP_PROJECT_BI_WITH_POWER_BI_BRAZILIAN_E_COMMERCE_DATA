# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

As part of my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze the Brazilian e-commerce dataset. The dataset was carefully prepared by removing unnecessary columns, correcting data types, and establishing key financial relationships, including Revenue, Freight Value, Payment Installments, and Customer Reviews.The dashboard tracks essential KPIs such as Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, Freight Cost, and Customer Satisfaction Score, providing valuable insights into sales performance, shipping costs, and customer behavior to support data-driven decision-making. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, e-commerce analytics, and Power BI visualization, enhancing my ability to interpret business data effectively. The project files have been submitted on GitHub for reference and further development.
